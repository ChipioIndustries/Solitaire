INFO

This is a simple project designed to showcase
my ability to create well-structured, properly
documented games. It's also a good chance to
practice Roact/Rodux.

You can look through the various scripts to
learn more about them and how to use them. The
game is not in a fully functional state, and
most of the effort has been put into the Roact
side of things.

Note about security/exploits: This entire game
is client-side, but that's not an issue in this
case since there's no multiplayer or even any
online functionality at all. The potential damage
is limited to anything that could also be done
by editing GUIs.
